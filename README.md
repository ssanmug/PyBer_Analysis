# PyBer Ride-share Data Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer over the first quarter (January - early May) of 2019 to assist the strategic planning of their ride-sharing services in the hopes of improving access and determining affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. After completing our initial visualizations, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type. The following report presents our visualizations, summarizes the differences in total weekly fares by city type, and provides recommendations for PyBer to improve their access and affordability.
